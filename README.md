This repository is the summary of my article - [How I Setup Database Migration using Sequelizejs for Microservice Architecture]()

If you're intested in how to build the migration repository from scratch with step-by-step guideline, you can read the article with the link above.

## Getting Started

1. Install all project dependencies.
    ```bash
    // Install all the dependencies
    npm install
    ```

2. Create `.env` by copy `.env.example`.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. Fill up the database credential into `.env` file.

You're good to go now. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
